# portfolio2

The option I choose to do was option 2 which is to create a new react native project. I created a math quiz application that has three separate screens. 

The reason this is different the previous quizes we have done is that it takes in Short answers rather than a multiple choice quiz. 
I also create a home page and survey page. The home page just has buttons linking to the other pages where the survey page is another user text input 
    that is for the user to leave feedback on what they thought of the quiz.
I had some issues with making the second question of the math quiz work but all the other functionality of the application should be working.
